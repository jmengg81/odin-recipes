    <p>
        I tried to make a copycat Popeyes® fried chicken sandwich and ended up with a hybrid between that and the one from Chick-fil-A®. So you get the best of both worlds and what's more, this DIY version never runs out, not even on Sundays.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            Marinade:
            <ul>
    <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 dash hot sauce, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon dry ranch dressing mix (such as Hidden Valley Ranch®)</li>
    <li>4 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    </ul>
    </ul>
        <ul>Breading:
<ul>
<li>1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
<li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
<li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>1 ½ teaspoons cayenne pepper (Optional)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon dry ranch dressing mix (such as Hidden Valley Ranch®)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
Wash:
<ul>
<li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
<li>½ cup buttermilk</li>
<li>¼ cup milk</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
The Rest:
<ul>
<li>canola oil for frying</li>
<li>4 soft hamburger buns, toasted and buttered</li>
<li>6 tablespoons mayonnaise, or to taste</li>
<li>12 dill pickle slices, or to taste</li>

</ul>
    </ul> 
<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Whisk buttermilk, salt, hot sauce, and ranch dressing mix together in a large bowl. Cut diagonal slits into the thick ends of chicken breasts and toss into marinade until well coated. Transfer to the refrigerator to marinate for 2 to 4 hours.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, make the breading: Mix flour, cornstarch, salt, pepper, cayenne, and ranch dressing mix together in a shallow dish.</li>
    <li>Make the wash: Whisk egg, buttermilk, and milk together in another bowl until combined.</li>
    <li>Use a fork to pull chicken from marinade, letting any excess drip off. Dip into the breading to coat both sides; shake off any excess. Dip into egg wash mixture to saturate surface; return to breading to coat, shake off excess, and repeat once more. Let sit on a wire rack to dry, at least 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer to between 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Fry chicken breasts in the hot oil until golden, crispy, and no longer pink in the centers, 4 to 5 minutes, flipping halfway through. Transfer to a plate topped with crinkled up aluminum foil to prevent bottoms from getting soggy.</li>
    <li>Spread mayonnaise over hamburger bun halves. Stuff with pickles and chicken.</li>
</ol>
